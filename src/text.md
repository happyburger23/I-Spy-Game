Object & Hints: The game has a predefined object (in this case, "apple") and a set of hints to help the player guess.

Player Input: The player is prompted to enter their guess after each hint.

Correct Guess: If the player guesses the object correctly, they win, and the game ends.

Out of Hints: If the player fails to guess correctly after all hints, the game reveals the object and ends.
